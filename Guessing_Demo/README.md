# Code Explanation

The given code is a Python script that creates a simple web-based guessing game using the Microdot framework. Players are prompted to guess a number between 1 and 100, and the game provides feedback on whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. Importing Dependencies:
   - `Microdot` and `Response` from the `microdot` package: A micro web framework for Python.
   - `random`: A standard library module used to generate random numbers.

2. Creating an instance of the Microdot application:
   ```python
   app = Microdot()
   ```
   - The `app` variable is initialized as a `Microdot` object, which will be used to define routes and handle HTTP requests.

3. Setting the default content type to 'text/html':
   ```python
   Response.default_content_type = 'text/html'
   ```
   - The `default_content_type` attribute of the `Response` class is set to 'text/html', which specifies that the response should be treated as HTML.

4. Defining the `htmldoc` function:
   ```python
   def htmldoc(guesses, message, color):
       # HTML code for the game interface
       return ...
   ```
   - The `htmldoc` function takes three parameters: `guesses` (the number of guesses made by the player), `message` (the feedback message for the current guess), and `color` (the color of the circle in the SVG image).
   - The function returns an HTML document containing the game interface, including the feedback message, input form, number of guesses, and an SVG circle with a specified color.

5. Generating a random number and initializing the number of guesses:
   ```python
   random_number = random.randint(1, 100)
   guesses = 0
   ```
   - The `random_number` variable is assigned a random integer between 1 and 100 using `random.randint(1, 100)`.
   - The `guesses` variable is initialized to 0.

6. Defining the route for the root path ('/') with GET and POST methods:
   ```python
   @app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
   def home(request):
       # Game logic and handling of player's guesses
       return htmldoc(guesses, message, color)
   ```
   - The `home` function is decorated with `@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])`, associating it with the root path ('/') and allowing both GET and POST methods for the route.
   - Depending on the HTTP method, the function performs different actions:
   - If the method is POST, the player's guess is extracted from the form data, and the function determines whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct. The appropriate feedback message and color are assigned accordingly. The number of guesses is incremented.
   - If the method is GET, a default message and color are assigned for the initial state of the game.
   - The function then returns the HTML document generated by the `htmldoc` function, passing in the appropriate values for `guesses`, `message`, and `color`.

7. Defining the route for starting a new game:
   ```python
   @app.route('/new_game', methods=['POST'])
   def new_game(request):
       # Logic for starting a new game
       return htmldoc(guesses, 'Guess a number between 1 and 100.', '515262') # Grey
   ```
   - The `new_game` function is decorated with `@app.route('/new_game', methods=['POST'])`, associating it with the '/new_game' path and allowing only the POST method.
   - When the player submits a form to start a new game, this function is called.
   - The function generates a new random number and resets the number of guesses to 0.
   - It then returns the HTML document generated by the `htmldoc` function, passing in the appropriate values for starting a new game.

8. Starting the application:
   ```python
   app.run(debug=True, port=8008)
   ```
   - The `app` object runs the web application with debugging enabled (`debug=True`) and listens on port 8008.
