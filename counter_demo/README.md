# Code Explanation

The provided code implements a simple web-based counter demo using the Microdot framework. The counter value can be incremented or decremented by clicking the corresponding buttons on the web page. Let's break down the code:

## Importing Dependencies

```python
from microdot import Microdot, Response
```

- The `Microdot` class is imported from the `microdot` package to create a micro web application.
- The `Response` class is imported to handle HTTP responses.

## Creating the Application

```python
app = Microdot()
Response.default_content_type = 'text/html'
```

- An instance of the `Microdot` class is created and assigned to the variable `app`.
- The `default_content_type` attribute of the `Response` class is set to `'text/html'`. This sets the default content type of the responses generated by the application as HTML.

## Defining the HTML Document Generator

```python
def htmldoc(counter):
    return f'''
        <html>
            <head>
                <title>Counter Demo</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <div>
                    <h1>Counter: {counter}</h1>
                    <a href="/change/{counter}/1"><button>Increment</button></a>
                    <a href="/change/{counter}/-1"><button>Decrement</button></a>
                </div>
            </body>
        </html>
        '''
```

- The `htmldoc` function generates an HTML document representing the counter demo interface.
- The function takes a `counter` parameter, which is used to display the current value of the counter in the HTML document.
- The HTML document includes a heading (`<h1>`) showing the counter value, and two buttons (`<button>`) wrapped in `<a>` tags. Each button is associated with a specific URL path (`/change/...`) representing the action to be performed on the counter.

## Defining Routes

```python
@app.route('/')
def home(request):
    return htmldoc(0)

@app.route('/change/<current_counter>/<step>')
def change(request, current_counter, step):
    counter = int(current_counter) + int(step)
    return htmldoc(counter)
```

- The `@app.route('/')` decorator associates the `home` function with the root path (`'/'`) of the application. This function is called when a user visits the root path.
- The `home` function calls the `htmldoc` function with an initial counter value of 0 and returns the generated HTML document.
- The `@app.route('/change/<current_counter>/<step>')` decorator associates the `change` function with a dynamic route that includes variable segments `<current_counter>` and `<step>`. This function is called when a user clicks on the increment or decrement buttons.
- The `current_counter` and `step` values are extracted from the URL path and converted to integers.
- The `counter` value is calculated by adding the current counter value and the step value.
- The `htmldoc` function is called with the new counter value, and the generated HTML document is returned.

## Starting the Application

```python
app.run(debug=True, port=8008)
```

- The `app.run()` method is called to start the application.
- The application runs in debug mode (`debug=True`), enabling detailed error messages if any occur.
- The application listens on port 8008 (`port=8008`) for incoming HTTP requests.
