## Neural Network + Expert System Project
In this project, my role involved developing a medical specialist AI agent. The main objective was to create an AI system capable of analyzing medical data from one of the MedMNIST datasets, such as OCTMNIST (Retinal OCT). To accomplish this, I utilized ChatGPT to conduct research and gather information about the dataset's modality and specific details. Additionally, I designed and implemented an expert system-style user interface, enhancing the usability and accessibility of the AI agent.
