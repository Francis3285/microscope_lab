# Code Explanation

The provided code is a Python script that implements a simple web-based traffic light control system using the Microdot framework. The traffic light consists of three circles representing red, yellow, and green lights. Users can click on each circle to toggle the corresponding light on or off. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Importing Dependencies:
   - `Microdot` and `Response` from the `microdot` package: A micro web framework for Python.

2. Creating an instance of the Microdot application:
   ```python
   app = Microdot()
   ```
   - The `app` variable is initialized as a `Microdot` object, which will be used to define routes and handle HTTP requests.

3. Setting the default content type to 'text/html':
   ```python
   Response.default_content_type = 'text/html'
   ```
   - The `default_content_type` attribute of the `Response` class is set to 'text/html', indicating that the response should be treated as HTML.

4. Defining the `htmldoc` function:
   ```python
   def htmldoc():
       # HTML code for the traffic light interface
       return ...
   ```
   - The `htmldoc` function constructs an HTML document representing the traffic light interface. It includes SVG code to display the traffic light circles, and their colors are determined based on the state of the `lights` list.
   - The `lights` list represents the current state of the traffic lights, with each element corresponding to a light (0 for off, 1 for on).
   - The function dynamically generates the SVG code based on the state of the `lights` list.

5. Defining the route for the root path ('/'):
   ```python
   @app.route('/')
   def hello(request):
       # Handling the root path request
       return htmldoc()
   ```
   - The `hello` function is decorated with `@app.route('/')`, associating it with the root path ('/').
   - The function returns the HTML document generated by the `htmldoc` function, displaying the initial state of the traffic lights.

6. Defining the route for toggling lights:
   ```python
   @app.route('/toggle/<light_index>')
   def toggle_light(request, light_index):
       # Handling the light toggle request
       return htmldoc()
   ```
   - The `toggle_light` function is decorated with `@app.route('/toggle/<light_index>')`, associating it with a route that includes a variable segment `<light_index>` representing the index of the light to toggle.
   - When a user clicks on a traffic light circle, this function is called with the corresponding `light_index`.
   - The function toggles the state of the specified light in the `lights` list (0 to 1 or 1 to 0).
   - It then returns the HTML document generated by the `htmldoc` function, displaying the updated state of the traffic lights.

7. Starting the application:
   ```python
   app.run(debug=True, port=8008)
   ```
   - The `app` object runs the web application with debugging enabled (`debug=True`) and listens on port 8008.
